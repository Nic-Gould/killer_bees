This project will be a conglomeration of idead from a few different sources. 

While working on the MPU driver, I was learning about quaternions and came across [this paper](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA247484.pdf) USNAVY 1993.

I've also been learning  some [CADAC](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/suppl/10.2514/4.102509) modelling for flight vehicle  and missile simulation, and thought it would be cool to try and re-implement it in rust, and in a way that makes sense to me. I typically do these projects both to practice programming and learn more about flight/defence applications, so duplicating existing work offers doesn't bother me. I learn the same either way. 

Finally, I came across [this post](https://www.jakobmaier.at/posts/flight-simulation/) recently, which at first I thought might be an implementation of the paper I cited above. It seems to provide a good example of structuring a basic flight dynamics program.

Essentially I'll be referencing ideas from all 3 of these sources to create some sort of unholy mess. 


Also, I know that no-one is reading this except me, but I PROMISE this will be the last new project, until I start finishing some. Starting projects is, for me, the equivelent of writing ideas down. It's a good way to park a thought so you can come back to it later.
