The N-S computational tools had the best overall agreement with test data when run
laminar for low angles of attack and turbulent for higher angles of attack (1)

The low-order, potential flow solvers, especially LSAero, provided good predictions in
the linear region for significantly cheaper cost both computationally and turn-around time.(1)

Heirarchy (3)
Time dependant navier stokes equations are the most accurate and most computationally expensive, and only have solutions for a specific subset of problems.
Options to improve performance can involve simiplificaiton of the flow by making certain assumptions. This results in the following modelling options in order of fidelity: 
    inviscid euler (non-linear)
    full potential equations - FPE (non-linear)
    laplace (linear) or Linear Potential Equations - LPE (lineaer)

Alternatively, other methods of solution or simiplificaiton result in the following modelling approaches, in order of fidelity:
    (DNS - direct numerical simulation,   LES - large eddy simulation,  Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes - RANS,)
    thin layer navier stokes TLNS
    classical boundary layer



recommended to combine methods to acheive a complete solution (3)
Lifting line and lifting surface theory, as well as vortex lattice methods, are limited to thin wings. Panel methods, on the other hand, are able to represent thickness. (3)

full potential equations (FPE) + Boundary layer equations (BLE) offer good accuracy vs computational intensity
field panel method (fpm) recommended to solve (FPE) due to ease of computation and compatability with BLE.


a comparison of DATCOM and XFLR for a 747 show DATCOM providing higher fidelity results for longitudintal coeffecients, while XFLR better estimated lateral coefficients, when each was compared to published data. (2)

an analysis of 11 solvers shows XLFR as providing VLM, panel  and LLT/LST methods for modelling inviscid irrotational incompressible flow, combined with XFOIL modelling including boundary layer modelling.
another advantage of xfoil is it was able to predict flow transition, where most 2d/hyrbid models failed (3)

Non linear solution methods (for systems of non-linear equations)
    finite difference
    finiite Element
    finite volume
